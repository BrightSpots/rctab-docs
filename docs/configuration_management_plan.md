# Section 12 - Configuration Management Plan

## 9.1 Configuration management plan

This document describes the Configuration Management Plan for the RCTab software.

## 9.2 Configuration management policy

RCTab v1.3.2 is a software-only utility. Tools and practices used to track development of RCTab are described below. In brief, we rely on the below practices to track and manage development of RCTab:

- Software tools for version control and update and issue tracking
- Configuration management policies, as outlined in this document
- Quality Assurance practices, as described in the QA Document and reflected in the GitHub issues tracking software

## 9.3 Configuration identification

RCTab consists of one non-COTS component: The RCTab software itself. A release of the RCTab software consists of the correctly identified version of the RCTab software, as identified following [**Section 22 - Installation Instructions for Windows OS**](installation_instructions_for_windows_os.md).

Any RCTab workstation should include the correct version of the RCTab software. For this version, that is:

- RCTab v1.3.2

Any hardware used should conform to the requirements described in [**Section 03 - System Hardware Specification**](system_hardware_specification.md). Any additional software should conform to the requirements described in this document and in [**Section 16 - System Hardening Procedures - Windows OS**](system_hardening_procedures_-_windows_os.md).

### 9.3.1 and 9.3.2: Software Versioning and Naming conventions

Our versioning conventions follow the conventions for semantic versioning as described at [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/) and [https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/Versioning.html](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/Versioning.html). In brief:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-buildNo, we increment:

- **PATCH** when we fix something
- **MINOR** when we add a new feature
- **MAJOR** when we break backwards-compatibility or add major features
- We use the **buildNo** to differentiate different builds off the same branch, and to differentiate between development, test and production builds.

A major release significantly alters the functionality of RCTab and changes how the user interacts with RCTab.

A minor release makes small improvements, contains a collection of bug fixes, or otherwise adds functionality to RCTab without changing the user experience.

Patch releases fix any critical bugs that must be fixed before a user can use the RCTab software.

File naming conventions for files produced by RCTab are described in [***Section 02 - Software Design and Specifications***](software_design_and_specifications.md).

**Documentation Naming and Versioning**

All documentation in this submission is named according to the formula:
\[Software version\] \[Document Number-\] \[Document Name\] \[Document version\]
Software Version: RCTab v1.3.2
Document version: 1.0.1
Example:
Section 11 - Quality Assurance Plan

Document names either reference the set of VVSG standards the document is responsive to or provide a brief description of the purpose or function of the information included in the document.

## 9.4 Baseline and promotion activities

The below sections describe how baseline software versions of RCTab are defined and how documentation baseline versions are defined.

### Establishing a baseline for RCTab

RCVRC & Bright Spots define a baseline for the RCTab software when a software release version of RCTab is merged and tested following the configuration control procedures described below.

### Promoting a subsequent version to baseline status & Maintenance Until Retirement

RCVRC & Bright Spots use an internal versioning scheme based upon the semantic versioning described above. Upon release of a version to the Voting System Test Lab, Bright Spots gives that version a three-part version number. If any bug fixes are needed in response to test findings, the third part of the version number (the PATCH label) is incremented to reflect the change.

The official version number is updated after a certification process completes.

Once a baseline is established, Bright Spots configures and incorporates all code changes according to the configuration control procedures described below. After code changes are regression tested and all tests pass, that version of the software is promoted to being the new baseline version of the software.

We use tags to track issues while they are being worked on, when any code updates are merged, and after issues are closed. Release notes for each release of RCTab note any changes made to the software and link out to the relevant issue for each change in the release. See [https://github.com/BrightSpots/rcv/releases/](https://github.com/BrightSpots/rcv/releases/) for examples of how these issues are tracked in release notes.

RCTab will be updated as necessary in the future, following the version control and source control procedures described in this document, until such time as the RCTab software itself is retired.

## 9.5 Configuration control procedures

### 9.5(a) Developing and Maintaining Internally Developed Items

We use Git version control software (git-scm.com) in conjunction with Github (github.com/BrightSpots/rcv) to coordinate the efforts of our developers and maintain a complete record of ALL software code changes to RCTab and the reasoning behind them.

All code changes submitted for incorporation into the RCTab software must undergo a manual code review from at least one developer other than the original drafter/developer.  Other stakeholders and experts are involved with code reviews as needed.  Code reviews offer an additional opportunity to identify potential issues, improve code structure, clarity, performance, and robustness.  Code merges are blocked until at least one developer explicitly approves the code submission, at which point the code is merged, and regression tests will be run.  For code review examples, see:  github.com/BrightSpots/rcv/pulls.

Documentation was all drafted in Google Docs, which tracks changes to all documents through its built-in document history. However, our TDP documentation was written to address compliance issues and not as a proactive feature of development. We plan to conduct an audit of all documentation after certification and plan to create a system for tracking and updating documentation into the future to ensure compliance with all requirements. Documents also include a Document Revision History box at the bottom of each document which notes dates of revision, describes any revisions made, tracks authors, and provides document version numbers. Document versioning will follow the versioning described above.

### 9.5(b) Acquiring and maintaining third party items

Third-party items included in the RCTab submission can be divided into two categories:

- COTS hardware that runs the RCTab software
- Open-source software artifacts included in the RCTab software

### Hardware

RCTab software runs on COTS computers. Jurisdictions purchase this COTS hardware directly, based on requirements provided by RCVRC and Bright Spots. The hardware used for RCTab software is discussed in [**Section 03 - System Hardware Specification**](system_hardware_specification.md).

### Software

All open-source software libraries and other tools included with RCTab software can be obtained and updated using the internet and are maintained by their respective authors unless stated otherwise in that productâ€™s documentation.

Bright Spots downloads the versions it requires and tracks the software versions needed for the operation of RCTab.

All third-party software included in RCTab software is unmodified.

Trusted Build instructions and verification steps are available in [**Section 14 - Tabulator Trusted Build Instructions**](tabulator_trusted_build_instructions.md).

The document [**Section 02 - Software Design and Specifications**](software_design_and_specifications.md) maintains a record of the software libraries and artifacts used in the RCTab software. For details on the software tools used to create RCTab, see [**Section 02 - Software Design and Specifications**](software_design_and_specifications.md).

### Additional COTS Software

Any RCTab workstation should also include the following COTS software:

- Windows 10 Pro, or above
- LibreOffice
- XML Notepad
- Users must also retain access to:
    * Command Prompt
    * Notepad
- UPS

All COTS software should be obtained from the original provider, as described in [**Section 16 - System Hardening Procedures - Windows OS**](system_hardening_procedures_-_windows_os.md).

### 9.5(c) & (d) Resolving internally and externally identified defects

Any defects discovered through testing or reported by users are recorded and tracked using Github issue tracking tools.  We confirm the existence of the defect, evaluate its severity, and mark it accordingly.  Depending on user impact, development resources, and release timelines, we schedule developers to address the defects in order of priority and then do the actual work.  Typically, this involves:

1. reproducing the defect;
1. making necessary code changes to fix the defect on an isolated git branch;
1. requesting a code review and implementing any changes arising from the code review
1. verifying that regression tests pass;
1. pushing the code change to the main branch and linking the issue in the commit message; and
1. closing the issue and linking to the commit in Github issue tracker.

In this way, we are able to ensure that all known issues are tracked, and the most important ones are mitigated according to criticality.  For more details, see: [https://github.com/BrightSpots/rcv/issues](https://github.com/BrightSpots/rcv/issues).

## 9.6 Release process

This section describes how RCTab is released to test labs and end users.

### 9.6.1 First release to an accredited test lab

RCVRC submits all RCTab artifacts necessary for testing to state election officials, or the relevant election officials. Those officials then submit materials to the test lab.

When RCTab is ready to download, RCVRC & Bright Spots sends an email to state election officials or test lab representatives. That email will contain a link to a downloadable version of the most recent build of RCTab and a SHA-512 hash code for the RCTab build shared. Downloads will either be provided through a Google Drive link or via the RCTab releases page on GitHub (https://github.com/brightspots/rcv). This SHA-512 hash code can be used to validate the version of the RCTab downloaded using the download link by following the instructions in ***Section*** ***23 - HashCode Instructions - Windows OS***.

After downloading and verifying files, the test lab will install the software as described in [***Section 22 - Installation Instructions for Windows OS***](installation_instructions_for_windows_os.md).

### 9.6.2 Upgrade Release Scenario

In the event that any upgrades or changes are made to the RCTab system, the RCVRC & Bright Spots will send a new download link as described above to download a new version of RCTab. Any previous versions of RCTab on hardware being used by the test lab will need to be uninstalled, which can be done by deleting RCTab folder and any files created or used by RCTab (such as configuration .json files, summary result .csv and .json files, audit .log files, and any CVRs used with RCTab).

### 9.6.3 & 9.6.5 Delivery and Installation of System to Jurisdiction

Jurisdictions will obtain the Trusted Build version of RCTab from the relevant State Election Officials on a flash drive or some other form of digital media. [***Section 22 - Installation Instructions for Windows OS***](installation_instructions_for_windows_os.md) explains how to install and verify RCTab. The RCTab version installed is also included in the operator log box at the bottom of the RCTab user interface.

### 9.6.4 Maintenance or Upgrade Release of System to Jurisdiction

RCTab upgrades will be released to jurisdictions after they have gone through necessary testing by state officials and test labs. Releases will be provided to jurisdictions as described in 9.6.3.

## 9.8 Configuration management resources

RCTab v1.3.2 is a software-only utility. The manufacturer uses Git as its distributed version-control system to track changes in the source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers and is used to track changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows. Here is a link to additional Git information: [Git External Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc/ext) (https://git-scm.com/doc/ext).

Git may be downloaded free via this link: [Git Download](https://git-scm.com/) (https://git-scm.com/).
The Bright Spots developers use GitVersion as the tool to achieve *Semantic Versioning* on the RCTab software development and upgrades.  Additional information is available in [***Section 13 - Quality Assurance Plan***](quality_assurance_plan.md) and here:  [GitVersion Information](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/Versioning.html) ([https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/Versioning.html](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/Versioning.html)).
