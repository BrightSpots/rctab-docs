# RCTab v2.0 Docs

RCTab is an open source tabulator for running ranked choice voting elections.

## User Guide
Start with the **[Quick Start](user_guide/user_guide.md)** if you are a new user. It will help you get RCTab configured and running tabulations.
It can be followed in sequential order: from installing RCTab on your computer, configuring it with your contest details and hardware, to getting results.

The **[User Guide Extended](user_guide/user_guide_extended.md)** contains more detailed information about RCTab for users who are looking to dig in to exactly how certain parts work. Sections here are roughly in order, but users can jump around to find exactly what they need.  

## Technical Documentation Package
The Technical Documentation Package or TDP contains detailed documentation to satisfy state and federal certification requirements. The RCTab v2.0 TDP is still being written.
