# Section 27 - RCTab Config Files

RCTabâ€™s Config File is generated by the software when creating a new election. The Config file is saved in a JSON format and should only be revised using RCTab software (do not attempt to edit the JSON file).  The Config File contains all the information necessary to conduct an election. The file must be validated using RCTab prior to tabulating an election.  See [**Section 18 - User Guide**](user_guide.md) for more. Here is a sample of the Config File:
