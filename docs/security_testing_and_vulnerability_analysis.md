# Section 07M - Security Testing and Vulnerability Analysis

**Objective:** This document shall describe security tests performed to identify vulnerabilities and the results of the testing. This also includes testing performed as part of software development, such as unit, module, and subsystem testing.

- We have developed a suite of 68 Tabulation Regression Tests and continue to add more tests as new features and bug fixes are added. These are designed to verify that various aspects of Tabulator functionality behave as expected. They also verify that new code changes do not inadvertently alter Tabulator behavior. The entire test suite must be run, and all tests must pass before any new code changes can be merged into the main Tabulator repository. See [**Section 17 - System Test and Verification Specification**](system_test_and_verification_specification.md) for additional information.
- Previous VSTL tests with Pro V&V conducted security regression reviews of RCTab versions 1.0.1, 1.1.0, and 1.2.0, all of which incorporated the security policies of the baseline system. Those tests found RCTab to have an applied level of security compliant with the verified VVSG 1.0 security provisions. Testing also found that RCTab does not impact the ability of the baseline system as modified to satisfy the VVSG 1.0 security requirements.
    * These tests also concluded that hash code procedures during the installation process and post-election process would help verify that the RCTab software as installed matches the trusted build of the software. See [**Section 22 - Installation Instructions for Windows OS**](installation_instructions_for_windows_os.md) and [**Section 23 - HashCode Instructions - Windows OS**](trusted_build_and_output_hash_verification.md) for more.
- A March 2021 test with SLI found that, “other than some high level access control assertions, RCVRC depends heavily on the security policies of the accompanying voting system, as well as the security policies of local jurisdictions.” Voting System Test Lab report results in early 2023 also found the need for enhanced security control. In response, version 1.3.2 was released with the following updates
    * [**Section 16 - System Hardening Procedures - Windows OS**](system_hardening_procedures_-_windows_os.md) enumerates steps for creating a ‘RCTab’ Windows Standard user account on the RCTab machine. Installation instructions for RCTab in [**Section 22 - Installation Instructions for Windows OS**](installation_instructions_for_windows_os.md) describe how to set up and run the RCTab software using the ‘RCTab’ user account which has the absolute minimum permissions necessary. Following these instructions ensures the following
        + RCTab users cannot edit or delete RCTab summary output files or audit logs.
        + RCTab users cannot edit or delete corresponding `.hash` files that can be used to verify the contents of all output files and audit logs.
    * When tabulation begins, RCTab automatically, programmatically verifies the cryptographic signature of all Hart CVRs used as input for contest tabulation. This verification step ensures both the integrity (CVR contents have not been edited) and provenance (CVRs came from the Hart voting system) of the Hart CVRs. RCTab will throw a halting error and tabulation will not begin if cryptographic validation of Hart’s CVR signature is not successful.
- See [**Section 07L - Security Threat Analysis**](security_threat_analysis.md) for additional analysis of potential threats to the RCTab software.
