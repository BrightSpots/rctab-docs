# Section 21 - Ballot Limitations & Maximum Testing Range

All vendors have ballot limits for using Ranked Choice Voting.  You should check with your voting system vendor for ballot layout limitations. See the list below for the five major vendors in the US and their Ranked Choice Voting limitations.

- ES&S
    * Portrait: 21 Maximum Number of Rankings
    * Landscape: 23 Maximum Number of Rankings
- Unisyn Voting
    * Grid/Portrait style: 3 Maximum Number of Rankings
- Hart Intercivic
    * Grid/Portrait style: 6 Maximum Number of Rankings
- Dominion Voting
    * Grid/Portrait Style: 10 Maximum Number of Rankings
- Clear Ballot
    * Not RCV compatible at this time.

We recommend that RCTab be tested at the outer limits of the ballot layout to ensure that the software can tabulate accurately within the range of the ballot limitations.
